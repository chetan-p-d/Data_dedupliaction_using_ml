# Data_dedupliaction_using_ml
# 🧹 Data Deduplication Removal using Machine Learning with Python

## 📌 Overview
Data duplication is a common problem in real-world datasets that can negatively impact analytics, reporting accuracy, and machine learning model performance.  
This project presents a Machine Learning–based approach to detect and remove duplicate and near-duplicate records from structured datasets.

The system intelligently identifies duplicates using similarity metrics and ML techniques, helping improve overall data quality.

---

## 🎯 Objective
To design an automated system that:
- Detects duplicate and near-duplicate records  
- Removes redundant entries  
- Produces a clean and reliable dataset  

---

## 🚀 Features
✔ Detects exact duplicates  
✔ Identifies near-duplicate records  
✔ Uses similarity comparison techniques  
✔ Machine Learning–based detection  
✔ Works with CSV / tabular datasets  
✔ Improves dataset consistency & accuracy

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- **Python**
- **Pandas**
- **NumPy**
- **Scikit-learn**
- **Fuzzy Matching / Similarity Metrics**

---

## 📂 Dataset
The project works with structured datasets such as:

- CSV files  
- Tabular datasets  
- Records with potential duplicate entries  

*(You can use datasets like customer records, employee data, product listings, etc.)*

## ⚙️ Methodology
1. **Data Preprocessing**  
   - Handle missing values  
   - Normalize text fields  
   - Feature selection  

2. **Similarity Detection**  
   - Exact match detection  
   - Fuzzy matching  
   - Distance metrics  

3. **Duplicate Identification**  
   - Threshold-based filtering  
   - ML classification (optional)  

4. **Duplicate Removal**  
   - Remove redundant rows  
   - Generate cleaned dataset
